abstract = {Increasingly, BDI agents are being used not just for basic decision-making, but for more abstract ethical decisions. Several authors have built ad-hoc extensions of BDI systems that provide varying levels of sophistication. In this paper, we introduce a general-purpose approach for implementing ethical governors in BDI systems. With this we aim to provide a broad, flexible and consistent framework for implementing increasingly complex ethical reasoning. Our approach is based on a set of domain-independent abstract agents (evidential reasoner, arbiter and execution agent) that together represent an ethical governor. We discuss the implementation of these abstract agents in the Jason agent programming language and demonstrate how they can be used in practice by instantiating agents in two different case studies, one using utilitarianism and the other deontic logic for reasoning about ethical decisions.},

   abstract = {Recently, Digital Data Marketplaces (DDMs) are gaining wide attention as a sharing platform among different organizations. That is due to the fact that sharing the information and participating in research collaborations play an important role in addressing multiple scientific challenges. To increase trust among participating organizations multiple contracts and agreements should be established in order to determine regulations and policies about who has access to what. Describing these agreements in a general model to be applicable in different DDMs is of utmost importance. In this paper, we present a semantic model for describing the access policies by means of semantic web technologies. In particular, we use and extend the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) to describe the pre-established agreements in a DDM.},

   abstract = {Big data is one of the most recent business and technical issues in the age of technology. Hundreds of millions of events occur every day. The financial field is deeply involved in the calculation of big data events. As a result, hundreds of millions of financial transactions occur in the financial world each day. Therefore, financial practitioners and analysts consider it an emerging issue of the data management and analytics of different financial products and services. Also, big data has significant impacts on financial products and services. Therefore, identifying the financial issues where big data has a significant influence is also an important issue to explore with the influences. Based on these concepts, the objective of this paper was to show the current landscape of finance dealing with big data, and also to show how big data influences different financial sectors, more specifically, its impact on financial markets, financial institutions, and the relationship with internet finance, financial management, internet credit service companies, fraud detection, risk analysis, financial application management, and so on. The connection between big data and financial-related components will be revealed in an exploratory literature review of secondary data sources. Since big data in the financial field is an extremely new concept, future research directions will be pointed out at the end of this study.},

   abstract = {Health data are increasingly being generated at a massive scale, at various levels of phenotyping and from different types of resources. Concurrent with recent technological advances in both data-generation infrastructure and data-analysis methodologies, there have been many claims that these events will revolutionize healthcare, but such claims are still a matter of debate. Addressing the potential and challenges of big data in healthcare requires an understanding of the characteristics of the data. Here we characterize various properties of medical data, which we refer to as ‘axes’ of data, describe the considerations and tradeoffs taken when such data are generated, and the types of analyses that may achieve the tasks at hand. We then broadly describe the potential and challenges of using big data in healthcare resources, aiming to contribute to the ongoing discussion of the potential of big data resources to advance the understanding of health and disease.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a formal framework for the construction of normative multiagent systems, based on Searle's notion of the construction of social reality. Within the structure of normative multiagent systems we distinguish between regulative norms that describe obligations, prohibitions and permissions, and constitutive norms that regulate the creation of institutional facts as well as the modification of the normative system itself. Using the metaphor of normative systems as agents, we attribute mental attitudes to the normative system. In particular, we formalize regulative norms as goals of the normative system, and constitutive norms as beliefs of the normative system. Agents reason about norm creation using recursive modelling.},

In the current paper, we adapt the original BOID with an aim to model autonomous agency. The new BOID* architecture is able to capture anticipation that we believe to be one of the hallmarks of autonomous agency. We focus on developing algorithms for anticipatory reasoning through a new BOID* goal deliberation component. The key method that BOID* introduces is abductive reasoning as a way to represent motivational attitudes, such as desires and obligations. As a result of deliberation via abduction, BOID* specifies intention revision procedures that connect motivational and informational attitudes. The BOID* is a part of the project to build autonomous AI models that make explicit the reasoning behind adopting future goals, prioritizing selected goals and forming intentions.},

In this work we focus on a related, yet under-studied feature:abstract goals. These constructs refer to the ability of agents to adopt goals that are not fully grounded at the moment of invocation, refining them only when and where needed: the ability to selectwhat-to (concretely) achieve at run-time. We present a preference-based approach to goal refinement, defining preferences based on extendedCeteris Paribus Networks (CP-Nets) for an AgentSpeak(L)-like agent programming language, and mapping the established CP-Nets logic and algorithms to guide the goal refinement step. As a technical contribution, we present an implementation of this method that solely uses a Prolog-like inference engine of the agent's belief-base to reason about preferences, thus minimally affecting the decision-making mechanisms hard-coded in the agent framework.},

@inproceedings{Mohajeri2019Prefs,
abstract = {Computational agents based upon the belief-desire-intention (BDI) architecture generally use reactive rules to trigger the execution of plans. For various reasons, certain plans might be preferred over others at design time. Most BDI agents platforms use hard-coding these preferences in some form of the static ordering of the reactive rules, but keeping the preferential structure implicit limits script reuse and generalization. This paper proposes an approach to add qualitative preferences over adoption/avoidance of procedural goals into an agent script, building upon the well-known notation of conditional ceteris paribus preference networks (CP-nets). For effective execution, the procedural knowledge and the preferential structure of the agent are mapped in an off-line fashion into a new reactive agent script. This solution contrasts with recent proposals integrating preferences as a rationale in the decision making cycle, and so overriding the reactive nature of BDI agents.},

@inproceedings{Mohajeri2020Prefs,
abstract = {Current agent architectures implementing the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model consider agents which respond reactively to internal and external events by selecting the first-available plan. Priority between plans is hard-coded in the program, and so the reasons why a certain plan is preferred remain in the programmer's mind. Recent works that attempt to include explicit preferences in BDI agents treat preferences essentially as a rationale for planning tasks to be performed at run-time, thus disrupting the reactive nature of agents. In this paper we propose a method to include declarative preferences (i.e. concerning states of affairs) in the agent program, and to use them in a manner that preserves reactivity. To achieve this, the plan prioritization step is performed offline, by (a) generating all possible outcomes of situated plan executions, (b) selecting a relevant subset of situation/outcomes couplings as representative summary for each plan, (c) sorting the plans by evaluating summaries through the agent's preferences. The task of generating outcomes in several conditions is performed by translating the agent's procedural knowledge to an ASP program using discrete-event calculus.},

abstract = {Most normative systems make use of explicit representations of norms (namely, obligations, prohibitions, and permissions) and associated mechanisms to support the self-regulation of open societies of self-interested and autonomous agents. A key problem in research on normative systems is that of how to synthesise effective and efficient norms. Manually designing norms is time consuming and error prone. An alternative is to automatically synthesise norms. However, norm synthesis is a computationally complex problem. We present a novel online norm synthesis mechanism, designed to synthesise compact normative systems. It yields normative systems composed of concise (simple) norms that effectively coordinate a multiagent system (MAS) without lapsing into overregulation. Our mechanism is based on a central authority that monitors a MAS, searching for undesired states. After detecting undesirable states, the central authority then synthesises norms aimed to avoid them in the future. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experimental results.},

This paper studies the problem of relaxing a plan into a partial plan which specifies which operators must be exe- cuted, but need not completely specify their order or variable bindings. While partial plans can provide an agent with addi- tional flexibility and robustness at execution time, many op- erations over partial plans are intractable. This paper tackles this problem by proposing and empirically evaluating a fixed- parameter tractable algorithm which searches for tractable, flexible partial plans.},

abstract = {In the RETSINA multi-agent system, each agent is provided with an internal planning component—HITaP. Each agent, using its internal planner, formulates detailed plans and executes them to achieve local and global goals. Knowledge of the domain is distributed among the agents, therefore each agent has only partial knowledge of the state of the world. Furthermore, the domain changes dynamically, therefore the knowledge available might become obsolete. To deal with these issues, each agent's planner allows it to interleave planning and execution of information gathering actions, to overcome its partial knowledge of the domain and acquire information needed to complete and execute its plans. Information necessary for an agent's local plan can be acquired through cooperation by the local planner firing queries to other agents and monitoring for their results. In addition, the local planner deals with the dynamism of the domain by monitoring it to detect changes that can affect plan construction and execution. Teams of agents, each of which incorporates a local RETSINA planner have been implemented. These agents cooperate to solve problems in different domains that range from portfolio management to command and control decision support systems.},

abstract = {Abstract Agents situated in dynamic and uncertain environments require several capabilities for successful operation. Such agents must monitor the world and respond appropriately to important events. The agents should be able to accept goals, synthesize complex plans for achieving those goals, and execute the plans while continuing to be responsive to changes in the world. As events render some current activities obsolete, the agents should be able to modify their plans while continuing activities unaffected by those events. The Cypress system is a domain-independent framework for defining persistent agents with this full range of behaviour. Cypress has been used for several demanding applications, including military operations, real-time tracking, and fault diagnosis.},

abstract = {Agent programming languages have often avoided the use of automated (first principles or hierarchical) planners in favour of predefined plan/recipe libraries for computational efficiency reasons. This allows for very efficient agent reasoning cycles, but limits the autonomy and flexibility of the resulting agents, oftentimes with deleterious effects on the agent's performance. Planning agents can, for instance, synthesise a new plan to achieve a goal for which no predefined recipe worked, or plan to make viable the precondition of a recipe belonging to a goal being pursued. Recent work on integrating automated planning with belief-desire-intention (BDI)-style agent architectures has yielded a number of systems and programming languages that exploit the efficiency of standard BDI reasoning, as well as the flexibility of generating new recipes at runtime. In this paper, we survey these efforts and point out directions for future work.},

abstract = {Advance in applied scheduling is a source of innovation in the manufacturing field, where new results help industrial prac- titioners in improving manufacturing line performances. In this domain, the manufacturing line environment is usually assumed to be static, in contrast to real life scenarios where disruptions are frequent and the original solution can dras- tically change. To address this intrinsic characteristic of a real environment, the scheduling system accounted to pro- vide the solution for the production schedule needs to be able of monitoring possible disruptions and, through a reschedul- ing process, to produce a new scheduling solution that con- siders the unforeseen. The literature of rescheduling prob- lems in the case of single-objective optimization is a well study field, while there is a lack of extensive studies for the case of rescheduling for multi-objective optimization, espe- cially when one of the objective represents energy measures (energy aware scheduling). To improve the field, this paper extends a previous work over an energy aware scheduling problem, modeled from a real industrial case study, extend- ing the manufacturing environment as a dynamic one and in- troducing specific rescheduling techniques tackling the ma- chines unavailabilities through new rescheduling techniques. Two new rescheduling techniques are developed (greedy- heuristic and meta-heuristic) and compared to existing ap- proach thought manufacturing environment simulations. The results give insight over which techniques better performs in terms of rescheduling quality and computational time.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore the question of what characterises a desirable plan of action and how such a plan could be computed, in the context of systems that already possess a certain amount of hierarchical domain knowledge. In contrast to past work in this setting, which focuses on generating low-level plans, losing much of the domain knowledge inherent in such systems, we argue that plans ought to be HTN-like or abstract, i.e., re-use and respect the user-supplied know-how in the underlying domain. In doing so, we recognise an intrinsic tension between striving for abstract plans but ensuring that unnecessary actions, not linked to the specific goal to be achieved, are avoided. We explore this tension by characterising the set of “ideal” abstract plans that are non-redundant but maximally abstract, and then develop a more limited yet feasible account in which a given (arbitrary) abstract plan is “specialised” into one such non-redundant plan that is as abstract as possible. We present an algorithm that can compute such specialisations, and analyse the theoretical properties of our proposal.},

In a recent paper, we proposed an “angelic” semantics for HLAs that supports proofs that a high-level plan will (or will not) achieve a goal, without first reducing the plan to primitive action sequences. This paper extends the angelic semantics with cost informa- tion to support proofs that a high-level plan is (or is not) op- timal. We describe the Angelic Hierarchical A* algorithm, which generates provably optimal plans, and show its advan- tages over alternative algorithms. We also present the Angelic Hierarchical Learning Real-Time A* algorithm for situated agents, one of the first algorithms to do hierarchical looka- head in an online setting. Since high-level plans are much shorter, this algorithm can look much farther ahead than pre- vious algorithms (and thus choose much better actions) for a given amount of computational effort.},

@article{DeSilva2009,
abstract = {BDI (Belief, Desire, Intention) agent systems are very powerful, but they lack the ability to incorporate planning. There has been some previous work to incorporate planning within such systems. However, this has either focussed on producing low-level plan sequences, losing much of the domain knowledge inherent in BDI systems, or has been limited to HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) planning, which cannot find plans other than those specified by the programmer. In this work, we incorporate classical planning into a BDI agent, but in a way that respects and makes use of the procedural domain knowledge available, by producing abstract plans that can be executed using such knowledge. In doing so, we recognize an intrinsic tension between striving for abstract plans and, at the same time, ensuring that unnecessary actions, unrelated to the specific goal to be achieved, are avoided. We explore this tension, by first characterizing the set of "ideal" abstract plans that are non-redundant while maximally abstract, and then developing a more limited but feasible account in which an abstract plan is "specialized" into a new abstract plan that is non-redundant and preserves abstraction as much as possible. We describe an algorithm to compute such a plan specialization, as well as algorithms for the production of a valid high level plan, by deriving abstract planning operators from the BDI program.},

However, ignoring the wrong details can lead agents into building plans that do not work, or into costly backtracking and replan- ning once overlooked interdependencies come to light. We claim that associating systematically- generated summary information with plans' abstract operators can ensure plan correctness, even for asynchronously-executed plans that must be coordinated across multiple agents, while still achiev- ing valuable efficiency gains. In this paper, we formally characterize hierarchical plans whose actions have temporal extent, and describe a principled method for deriving summarized state and metric resource information for such actions. We provide sound and complete algorithms, along with heuristics, to exploit summary information during hierarchical refinement planning and plan coordination. Our analyses and experiments show that, under clearcut and reasonable conditions, using summary information can speed planning as much as doubly exponentially even for plans involving interacting subproblems.},

@article{Meneguzzi2013a,
abstract = {Practical agent languages and their corresponding architectures have often relied on a static plan library with more or less direct trigger-response activation mechanisms as a source for agent behaviours for the sake of runtime efficiency. Although efficient, such a language design choice severely limits an agent's ability to reason about its goals and adapt to unforeseen circumstances after being deployed. This effectively delegates the task of planning to the designers themselves, who must design plan libraries able to cope with every foreseeable situation an agent might find itself in by designing plans to deal with any contingency. In this paper we develop a formal conversion process from traditional BDI agent languages into declarative planning. Using this conversion process, we show how to integrate domain independent planning algorithms into the BDI interpreter, allowing a designer to program an agent not only through the trigger-response mechanism used in traditional languages, but also in terms of declarative goals. Our contribution here is twofold: firstly we increase an agent's ability to cope with unforeseen situations and secondly we unburden an agent designer from having to define multiple plan combinations that could be easily generated by a planner. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Duff2006,
abstract = {Goals are an important concept in intelligent agent systems, and can take a variety of forms. One such form is maintenance goals, which, unlike achievement goals, define states that must remain true, rather than a state that is to be achieved. Maintenance goals are generally restricted to acting as trigger conditions for goals or plans, and often take no part in any deliberation process. These goals are reactive and are only acted upon when the maintenance conditions are no longer true. In this paper, we study maintenance goals that are proactive, in that the agent system needs to not only react when the maintenance conditions fail, but also anticipate the failures of these conditions, and act in order to avoid them failing. This can be done by performing actions that prevent the condition from failing, or suspending goals that will cause the maintenance conditions to fail. We provide a representation for maintenance goals that captures both their reactive and proactive aspects, algorithms that identify in advance where maintenance conditions may not hold, and mechanisms for enabling preventative actions in such situations. We also provide some experimental results on an implementation of these ideas. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

The choice of means to achieve the goal in made by the system at run time, depending on contextual information that is not available in advance. In this article, we explore ways that the user of an agent system can specify preferences which can be incorporated into the BDI execution process and used to guide the choices made. For example, a user of a travel system can specify a preferred airline, or a particular kind of accommodation, and the system will use this information to satisfy the goal and preferences, if possible. Preferences are specified in terms of properties of goals and resource usage, and are used to make two types of decisions: (a) select a plan when there is a choice and (b) determine the order in which subgoals of a plan should be pursued when their order is not fixed by design. We have implemented our preference framework in Jadex, and provide detailed case studies within the context of a holiday travel agent application.},

@article{Sohrabi2009b,
abstract = {Automated Planning is an old area of AI that focuses on the development of techniques for finding a plan that achieves a given goal from a given set of initial states as quickly as possible. In most real-world applications, users of planning systems have preferences over the multitude of plans that achieve a given goal. These preferences allow to distinguish plans that are more desirable from those that are less desirable. Planning systems should therefore be able to construct high-quality plans, or at the very least they should be able to build plans that have a reasonably good quality given the resources available.In the last few years we have seen a significant amount of research that has focused on developing rich and compelling languages for expressing preferences over plans. On the other hand, we have seen the development of planning techniques that aim at finding high-quality plans quickly, exploiting some of the ideas developed for classical planning. In this paper we review the latest developments in automated preference-based planning. We also review various approaches for preference representation, and the main practical approaches developed so far.},

abstract = {An intelligent agent should be rational, in particular it should at least avoid pursuing goals which are definitely conflict- ing. In this paper we focus on resource conflict in agents that use a plan library organised around goals. We characterise different types of resources and define resource requirements summaries. We give algorithms for deriving resource requirements, using resource re- quirements to detect conflict, and maintaining dynamic updates of resource requirements. We also discuss ways of resolving resource conflict. Our approach does not represent time, rather it keeps re- source summaries current. This enables an agents decisions to be made on the basis of up-to-date information and allows us to develop efficient runtime (online) algorithms.},

abstract = {Nowadays a multitude of different agent platforms exist that aim to support the software engineer in developing multi-agent systems. Nevertheless, most of these platforms concentrate on specific objectives and therefore cannot address all important aspects of agent technology equally well. A broad distinction in this field can be made between middleware- and reasoning-oriented systems. The first category is mostly concerned with FIPA-related issues like interoperability, security and maintainability whereas the latter one emphasizes rationality and goal-directedness. In this paper the Jadex reasoning engine is presented, which supports cognitive agents by exploiting the BDI model and is realized as adaptable extension for agent middleware such as the widely used JADE platform.},

@article{Fisher2007,
abstract = {The concept of an agent is increasingly used in contemporary software applications, particularly those involving the Internet, autonomous systems, or cooperation. However, with dependability and safety in mind, it is vital that the mechanisms for representing and implementing agents are clear and consistent. Hence there has been a strong research effort directed at using formal logic as the basis for agent descriptions and agent implementation. Such a logical basis not only presents the clarity and consistency required but also allows for important techniques such as logical verification to be applied. We present a road map of research into the use of computational logic in agent-based systems and survey much of the recent work in these areas. Even though, with such a rapidly changing field, it is impossible to cover every development, we aim to give the reader sufficient background to understand the current research problems and potential future developments in this maturing area. ? 2007 Blackwell Publishing, Inc.},

abstract = {A long and lasting problem in agent research has been to close the gap between agent logics and agent programming frameworks. The main reason for this problem of establishing a link between agent logics and agent programming frameworks is identified and explained by the fact that agent programming frameworks have not incorporated the concept of a `declarative goal'. Instead, such frameworks have focused mainly on plans or `goals-to-do' instead of the end goals to be realised which are also called `goals-to-be'. In this paper, a new programming language called GOAL is introduced which incorporates such declarative goals. The notion of a `commitment strategy' - one of the main theoretical insights due to agent logics, which explains the relation between beliefs and goals - is used to construct a computational semantics for GOAL. Finally, a proof theory for proving properties of GOAL agents is introduced. Thus, we offer a complete theory of agent programming in the sense that our theory provides both for a programming framework and a programming logic for such agents. An example program is proven correct by using this programming logic.},

A large number of agent decision making models can be found in the literature, each inspired by different aims and research questions. In this paper we provide a review of 14 agent decision making architectures that have attracted interest. They range from production-rule systems to psychologically- and neurologically-inspired approaches. For each of the architectures we give an overview of its design, highlight research questions that have been answered with its help and outline the reasons for the choice of the decision making model provided by the originators. Our goal is to provide guidelines about what kind of agent decision making model, with which level of simplicity or complexity, to use for which kind of research question.},

@article{Herzig2018,
abstract = {The mental attitudes of belief, desire, and intention play a central role in the design and implementation of autonomous agents. In 1987 Bratman proposed their integration into a belief-desire-intention (BDI) theory that was seminal in AI. Since then numerous approaches were built on the BDI paradigm, both practical (BDI architectures and BDI agents) and formal (BDI logics). The logical approaches that were most influential are due to Cohen{\&}Levesque and to Rao{\&}Georgeff. However, three fundamental problems remain up to now. First, the practical and the formal approaches evolved separately and neither fertilized the other. Second, only few formal approaches addressed some important issues such as the revision of intentions or the fundamentally paraconsistent nature of desires, and it seems fair to say that there is currently no consensual logical account of intentions. Finally, only few publications study the interaction between intention and other concepts that are naturally connected to intention, such as actions, planning, and the revision of beliefs and intentions. Our paper summarizes the state of the art, discusses the main open problems, and sketches how they can be addressed. We argue in particular that research on intention should be better connected to fields such as reasoning about actions, automated planning, and belief revision and update.},

Therefore the process whereby goals arise from desires is given scant attention. In this paper we argue that the inclusion of both desires and goals in the same model can be important, particularly in a Multi-Agent System context, where other sources of individual motivation such as obligations and norms may be present. This leads us to propose an extended BDI architecture in which obligations, norms and desires are distinguished from goals and explicitly represented. In this paper we consider suitable logical representations for and properties of these elements, and describe the basic method of operation of the architecture, focusing on how goal generation and goal maintenance may occur.},

@article{Kambhampati1997,
abstract = {s Planning-the ability to synthesize a course of action to achieve desired goals-is an important part of intelligent agency and has thus received significant attention within AI for more than 30 years. Work on efficient planning algorithms still continues to be a hot topic for research in AI and has led to several exciting developments in the past few years. This article provides a tutorial introduction to all the algorithms and approaches to the planning problem in AI. To fulfill this ambitious objective, I introduce a generalized approach to plan synthesis called refinement planning and show that in its various guises, refinement planning subsumes most of the algorithms that have been, or are being, developed. It is hoped that this unifying overview provides the reader with a brand-name-free appreciation of the essential issues in planning. P lanning is the problem of synthesizing a course of action that, when executed, takes an agent from a given initial state to a desired goal state. Automating plan synthesis has been an important research goal in AI for more than 30 years. A large variety of algorithms, with differing empirical trade-offs, have been developed over this period. Research in this area is far from complete, with many exciting new algorithms continuing to emerge in recent years. To a student of planning literature, the wel-ter of ideas and algorithms for plan synthesis can at first be bewildering. I remedy this situation by providing a unified overview of the approaches for plan synthesis. I describe a general and powerful plan-synthesis paradigm called refinement planning and show that a majority of the traditional, as well as the newer , plan-synthesis approaches are special cases of this paradigm. It is my hope that this unifying treatment separates the essential trade-offs from the peripheral ones (for example, brand-name affiliations) and provides the reader with a firm understanding of the existing work as well as a feel for the important open research questions. In this article, I briefly discuss the (classical) planning problem in AI and provide a chronology of the many existing approaches. I then propose refinement planning as a way of unifying all these approaches and present the formal framework for refinement planning. Next, I describe the refinement strategies that correspond to existing planners. I then discuss the trade-offs among different refinement-planning algorithms. Finally, I describe some promising new directions for scaling up refinement-planning algorithms. Planning and Classical Planning Intelligent agency involves controlling the evolution of external environments in desirable ways. Planning provides a way in which the agent can maximize its chances of achieving this control. Informally, a plan can be seen as a course of action that the agent decides on based on its overall goals, information about the current state of the environment , and the dynamics of the evolution of its environment (figure 1). The complexity of plan synthesis depends on a variety of properties of the environment and the agent, including whether (1) the environment evolves only in response to the agent's actions or also independently, (2) the state of the environment is observable or partially hidden, (3) the sensors of the agent are powerful enough to perceive the state of the environment, and (4) the agent's actions have deterministic or stochastic effects on the state Articles},

@article{Hoffmann2006,
abstract = {There is increasing awareness that planning and model checking are closely related fields. Abstraction means to perform search in an over-approximation of the original problem instance, with a potentially much smaller state space. This is the most essential method in model checking. One would expect that it can also be made successful in planning. We show, however, that this is likely to not be the case. The main reason is that, while in model checking one traditionally uses blind search to exhaust the state space and prove the absence of solutions, in planning informed search is used to find solutions. We give an exhaustive theoretical and practical account of the use of abstraction in planning. For all abstraction (over-approximation) methods known in planning, we prove that they cannot improve the best-case behavior of informed search. While this is easy to see for heuristic search, we were quite surprised to find that it also holds, in most cases, for the resolution-style proofs of unsolvability underlying SAT-based optimal planners. This result is potentially relevant also for model checking, where SAT-based techniques have recently been combined with abstraction. Exploring the issue in planning practice, we find that even hand-made abstractions do not tend to improve the performance of planners, unless the attacked task contains huge amounts of irrelevance. We relate these findings to the kinds of application domains that are typically addressed in model checking.},

We chose Jason, 2APL, and GOAL as the agent-oriented programming languages and Erlang, Akka, and ActorFoundry as the actor-oriented programming languages. Overall, Erlang displayed the best performance of all languages used in this comparison, followed by ActorFoundry, Akka, Jason, 2APL, and GOAL, in this particular order.},

abstract = {Intelligence and interaction are two key-issues in the engineering of todaycomp lex systems, like Internet-based ones. To make logic languages accomplish their vocation of sound enabling technologies for intelligent components, we first need their implementations to strictly meet some engineering properties such as deployability, configurability, and scalability. Then, we should provide them with a wide range of interaction capabilities, according to standards and common practices. This would make logic-based systems also viable tools to build deployable, configurable, dynamic, and possibly intelligent infrastructures.In this paper, we present tuProlog, a light-weight Java-based system allowing configurable and scalable Prolog components to be built and integrated into standard Internet applications according to a multiplicityof different interaction patterns, like JavaBeans, RMI, CORBA, and TCP/IP. Even more, tuProlog offers basic coordination capabilities in terms of logic tuple spaces, which allow complex Internet-based architectures to be designed and governed. This makes it possible to use tuProlog as the core enabling technologyf or Internet infrastructures - as in the case of the TuCSoN and LuCe infrastructures for the coordination of Internet-based multi-agent systems.},

It has inspired the development of several actor-based languages, whose adoption depends, to a large extent, on the runtime characteristics ( the performance and scaling behaviour) of programs written in these languages. This paper investigates the relative runtime characteristics of Akka, CAF and Pony, based on the Savina benchmarks. We observe that the scaling of many of the Savina benchmarks does not reflect their categorization (into essentially sequential, concurrent and parallel), that many programs have similar runtime characteristics, and that their runtime behaviour may drastically change nature ( go from essentially sequential to parallel) by tweaking some parameters. These observations lead to our proposal of a single benchmark program which we designed so that through tweaking of some knobs (we hope) we can simulate most of the programs of the Savina suite.},

Now in its seventh year, it was felt that organising a competition for evaluating MASs based on computational logic was appropriate. The authors took on this task, which turned out to be quite difficult under the given time frame. We believe that this competition is a first (modest) step towards (1) collecting important benchmarks, (2) identifying advantages/shortcomings and, finally, (3) advertising the use of Computational Logic to the broader MAS audience, and foster integration of Computational Logic into existing agent-oriented software engineering frameworks.},

Its high level of abstraction combined with its flexibility and efficiency makes it appealing for large applications in concurrent and distributed regimes.In this paper, we report on our work of designing and building CAF, the "C++ Actor Framework". CAF targets at providing an extremely scalable native environment for building high-performance concurrent applications and distributed systems. Based on our previous library tt libcppa, CAF significantly extends its scopes of application and operation, as well as the range of scalability. The particular contributions of this paper are threefold. First we present the design and implementation of a type-safe messaging interface for actors that rules out a category of runtime errors and facilitates robust software design. Second we introduce a runtime inspection shell as a first building block for convenient debugging of distributed actors. Finally we enhance the scheduling facilities and improve scaling up to high numbers of concurrent processors. Extensive performance evaluations indicate ideal runtime behaviour for up to 64 cores at very low memory footprint. In these tests, CAF clearly outperforms competing actor environments.},

Without a lightweight process abstraction, users are often forced to write parts of concurrent applications in an event-driven style which obscures control flow, and increases the burden on the programmer. In this paper we show how thread-based and event-based programming can be unified under a single actor abstraction. Using advanced abstraction mechanisms of the Scala programming language, we implement our approach on unmodified JVMs. Our programming model integrates well with the threading model of the underlying VM."

In current practice, programmers are required to either manually terminate actors, or they have to rely on garbage collection systems that monitor actor mutation through write barriers, thread coordination through locks etc. These techniques, however, prevent the collector from being fully concurrent.We developed a protocol that allows garbage collection to run fully concurrently with all actors. The main challenges in concurrent garbage collection is the detection of cycles of sleeping actors in the actors graph, in the presence of concurrent mutation of this graph. Our protocol is solely built on message passing: it uses deferred direct reference counting, a dedicated actor for the detection of (cyclic) garbage, and a confirmation protocol (to deal with the mutation of the actor graph).We present our ideas informally through an example, and then present a formal model, prove soundness and argue completeness. We have implemented the protocol as part of a runtime library. As a preliminary performance evaluation, we discuss the performance of our approach as currently used at a financial institution, and use four benchmarks from the literature to compare our approach with other actor-model systems. These preliminary results indicate that the overhead of our approach is small.},

abstract={The mental attitudes of belief, desire, and intention play a central role in the design and implementation of autonomous agents. In 1987, Bratman proposed their integration into a belief--desire--intention (BDI) theory that was seminal in AI. Since then numerous approaches were built on the BDI paradigm, both practical (BDI architectures and BDI agents) and formal (BDI logics). The logical approaches that were most influential are due to Cohen and Levesque and to Rao and Georgeff. However, three fundamental problems remain up to now. First, the practical and the formal approaches evolved separately and neither fertilised the other. Second, only few formal approaches addressed some important issues such as the revision of intentions or the fundamentally paraconsistent nature of desires, and it seems fair to say that there is currently no consensical, comprehensive logical account of intentions. Finally, only few publications study the interaction between intention and other concepts that are naturally connected to intention, such as actions, planning, and the revision of beliefs and intentions. Our paper summarizes the state of the art, discusses the main open problems, and sketches how they can be addressed. We argue in particular that research on intention should be better connected to fields such as reasoning about actions, automated planning, and belief revision and update.},

abstract = {We propose a framework that adds learning for improving plan selection in the popular BDI agent programming paradigm. In contrast with previous proposals, the approach given here is able to scale up well with the complexity of the agent's plan library. Technically, we develop a novel confidence measure which allows the agent to adjust its reliance on the learning dynamically, facilitating in principle infinitely many (re)learning phases. We demonstrate the benefits of the approach in an example controller for energy management.},

@article{Dignum2002,
abstract = {Traditional models of agents based on Beliefs, Desires and Intentions usually only include either desires or goals. Therefore the process whereby goals arise from desires is given scant attention. In this paper we argue that the inclusion of both desires and goals in the same model can be important, particularly in a Multi-Agent System context, where other sources of individual motivation such as obligations and norms may be present. This leads us to propose an extended BDI architecture in which obligations, norms and desires are distinguished from goals and explicitly represented. In this paper we consider suitable logical representations for and properties of these elements, and describe the basic method of operation of the architecture, focusing on how goal generation and goal maintenance may occur.},

These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the interest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what interpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this position paper, we first define interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous science of interpretable machine learning.},

abstract = {Under international law, weapon capabilities and their use are regulated by legal requirements set by International Humanitarian Law (IHL). Currently, there are strong military incentives to equip capabilities with increasingly advanced artificial intelligence (AI), which include opaque (less transparent) models. As opaque models sacrifice transparency for performance, it is necessary to examine whether their use remains in conformity with IHL obligations. First, we demonstrate that the incentives for automation drive AI toward complex task areas and dynamic and unstructured environments, which in turn necessitates resort to more opaque solutions. We subsequently discuss the ramifications of opaque models for foreseeability and explainability. Then, we analyse their impact on IHL requirements from a development, pre-deployment and post-deployment perspective. We find that while IHL does not regulate opaque AI directly, the lack of foreseeability and explainability frustrates the fulfilment of key IHL requirements to the extent that the use of fully opaque AI could violate international law. States are urged to implement interpretability during development and seriously consider the challenging complication of determining the appropriate balance between transparency and performance in their capabilities.},

abstract = {The leadership of the Department of Defense (DoD) tasked the Defense Innovation Board (DIB) with proposing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics Principles for DoD for the design, development, and deployment of AI for both combat and non-combat purposes. Building upon the foundation of DoD's existing ethical, legal, and policy frameworks and responsive to the complexities of the rapidly evolving field of AI, the Board sought to develop principles consistent with the Department's mission to deter war and ensure the country's security. This document summarizes the DIB's project and includes a brief background; an outline of enduring DoD ethics principles that transcend AI; a set of proposed AI Ethics Principles; and a set of recommendations to facilitate the Department's adoption of these principles and advance the wider aim of promoting AI safety, security, and robustness. The DIB's complete report includes detailed explanations and addresses the wider historical, policy, and theoretical context for these recommendations. It is available at innovation.defense.gov/ai. The DIB is an independent federal advisory committee that provides advice and recommendations to DoD senior leaders; it does not speak for DoD. The purpose of this report is an earnest attempt to provide an opening for a thought-provoking dialogue internally to Department and externally in our wider society. The Department has the sole responsibility to determine how best to proceed with the recommendations made in this report. II.},

@article{120Szpak,
abstract = {Along with the rapid development and proliferation of autonomous robotic weapons, machines are beginning to replace people on battlefields. The use by the USA of Predators or Reapers and other unmanned aerial vehicles in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other places in the world clearly signals a distancing of soldiers from their targets. In this article I concentrate on fully autonomous weapons. The theses of the article are as follows: the use of autonomous weapons would be contrary to the basic and fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, such as the principles of distinction and proportionality, and thus illegal. As such, their use would threaten the wellbeing, life and health of civilians and civilian populations. Their use would undermine the whole concept of the rules of war. Still, there are scholars who are of the opinion that prohibiting the use of autonomous weapons would make no sense at all and that the development of such weapons is inevitable and will take place gradually. Their use would be an expression of the technological dimension of international security. As this article will attempt to demonstrate, the drawbacks of the use of autonomous weapons are of such magnitude that they exclude the legality of such devices.},

@article{Hendrycks2018,
abstract = {In this paper we establish rigorous benchmarks for image classifier robustness. Our first benchmark, ImageNet-C, standardizes and expands the corruption robustness topic, while showing which classifiers are preferable in safety-critical applications. Unlike recent robustness research, this benchmark evaluates performance on commonplace corruptions not worst-case adversarial corruptions. We find that there are negligible changes in relative corruption robustness from AlexNet to ResNet classifiers, and we discover ways to enhance corruption robustness. Then we propose a new dataset called Icons-50 which opens research on a new kind of robustness, surface variation robustness. With this dataset we evaluate the frailty of classifiers on new styles of known objects and unexpected instances of known classes. We also demonstrate two methods that improve surface variation robustness. Together our benchmarks may aid future work toward networks that learn fundamental class structure and also robustly generalize.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is used increasingly in real-world applications. In this paper, we describe our ongoing endeavor to define characteristics and challenges unique to Requirements Engineering (RE) for ML-based systems. As a first step, we interviewed four data scientists to understand how ML experts approach elicitation, specification, and assurance of requirements and expectations. The results show that changes in the development paradigm, i.e., from coding to training, also demands changes in RE. We conclude that development of ML systems demands requirements engineers to: (1) understand ML performance measures to state good functional requirements, (2) be aware of new quality requirements such as explainability, freedom from discrimination, or specific legal requirements, and (3) integrate ML specifics in the RE process. Our study provides a first contribution towards an RE methodology for ML systems.},

@article{Lohn2020,
abstract = {Test, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation (TEVV) for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a challenge that threatens to limit the economic and societal rewards that AI researchers have devoted themselves to producing. A central task of TEVV for AI is estimating brittleness, where brittleness implies that the system functions well within some bounds and poorly outside of those bounds. This paper argues that neither of those criteria are certain of Deep Neural Networks. First, highly touted AI successes (eg. image classification and speech recognition) are orders of magnitude more failure-prone than are typically certified in critical systems even within design bounds (perfectly in-distribution sampling). Second, performance falls off only gradually as inputs become further Out-Of-Distribution (OOD). Enhanced emphasis is needed on designing systems that are resilient despite failure-prone AI components as well as on evaluating and improving OOD performance in order to get AI to where it can clear the challenging hurdles of TEVV and certification.},

abstract="The paper presents a first tentative work that investigates the interest and the questions raised by the introduction of argumentation capabilities in multiple criteria decision-making. Emphasizing the positive and the negative aspects of possible choices, by means of arguments in favor or against them is valuable to the user of a decision-support system. In agreement with the symbolic character of arguments, the proposed approach remains qualitative in nature and uses a bipolar scale for the assessment of criteria. The paper formalises a multicriteria decision problem within a logical argumentation system. An illustrative example is provided. Various decision principles are considered, whose psychological validity is assessed by an experimental study.",

abstract = {As machine learning systems become ubiquitous, there has been a surge of interest in interpretable machine learning: systems that provide explanation for their outputs. These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the interest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what interpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this position paper, we first define interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous science of interpretable machine learning.},

Building upon the foundation of DoD's existing ethical, legal, and policy frameworks and responsive to the complexities of the rapidly evolving field of AI, the Board sought to develop principles consistent with the Department's mission to deter war and ensure the country's security. This document summarizes the DIB's project and includes a brief background; an outline of enduring DoD ethics principles that transcend AI; a set of proposed AI Ethics Principles; and a set of recommendations to facilitate the Department's adoption of these principles and advance the wider aim of promoting AI safety, security, and robustness. The DIB's complete report includes detailed explanations and addresses the wider historical, policy, and theoretical context for these recommendations. It is available at innovation.defense.gov/ai. The DIB is an independent federal advisory committee that provides advice and recommendations to DoD senior leaders; it does not speak for DoD. The purpose of this report is an earnest attempt to provide an opening for a thought-provoking dialogue internally to Department and externally in our wider society. The Department has the sole responsibility to determine how best to proceed with the recommendations made in this report. II.},

It argues in favour of a theoretical foundation for such a ban based on human rights and humanitarian principles that are not only moral, but also legal ones. In particular, an implicit requirement for human judgement can be found in international humanitarian law governing armed conflict. Indeed, this requirement is implicit in the principles of distinction, proportionality, and military necessity that are found in international treaties, such as the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and firmly established in international customary law. Similar principles are also implicit in international human rights law, which ensures certain human rights for all people, regardless of national origins or local laws, at all times. I argue that the human rights to life and due process, and the limited conditions under which they can be overridden, imply a specific duty with respect to a broad range of automated and autonomous technologies. In particular, there is a duty upon individuals and states in peacetime, as well as combatants, military organizations, and states in armed conflict situations, not to delegate to a machine or automated process the authority or capability to initiate the use of lethal force independently of human determinations of its moral and legal legitimacy in each and every case. I argue that it would be beneficial to establish this duty as an international norm, and express this with a treaty, before the emergence of a broad range of automated and autonomous weapons systems begin to appear that are likely to pose grave threats to the basic rights of individuals.},

abstract = {In this paper we establish rigorous benchmarks for image classifier robustness. Our first benchmark, ImageNet-C, standardizes and expands the corruption robustness topic, while showing which classifiers are preferable in safety-critical applications. Unlike recent robustness research, this benchmark evaluates performance on commonplace corruptions not worst-case adversarial corruptions. We find that there are negligible changes in relative corruption robustness from AlexNet to ResNet classifiers, and we discover ways to enhance corruption robustness. Then we propose a new dataset called Icons-50 which opens research on a new kind of robustness, surface variation robustness. With this dataset we evaluate the frailty of classifiers on new styles of known objects and unexpected instances of known classes. We also demonstrate two methods that improve surface variation robustness. Together our benchmarks may aid future work toward networks that learn fundamental class structure and also robustly generalize.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is used increasingly in real-world applications. In this paper, we describe our ongoing endeavor to define characteristics and challenges unique to Requirements Engineering (RE) for ML-based systems. As a first step, we interviewed four data scientists to understand how ML experts approach elicitation, specification, and assurance of requirements and expectations. The results show that changes in the development paradigm, i.e., from coding to training, also demands changes in RE. We conclude that development of ML systems demands requirements engineers to: (1) understand ML performance measures to state good functional requirements, (2) be aware of new quality requirements such as explainability, freedom from discrimination, or specific legal requirements, and (3) integrate ML specifics in the RE process. Our study provides a first contribution towards an RE methodology for ML systems.},

abstract = {Test, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation (TEVV) for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a challenge that threatens to limit the economic and societal rewards that AI researchers have devoted themselves to producing. A central task of TEVV for AI is estimating brittleness, where brittleness implies that the system functions well within some bounds and poorly outside of those bounds. This paper argues that neither of those criteria are certain of Deep Neural Networks. First, highly touted AI successes (eg. image classification and speech recognition) are orders of magnitude more failure-prone than are typically certified in critical systems even within design bounds (perfectly in-distribution sampling). Second, performance falls off only gradually as inputs become further Out-Of-Distribution (OOD). Enhanced emphasis is needed on designing systems that are resilient despite failure-prone AI components as well as on evaluating and improving OOD performance in order to get AI to where it can clear the challenging hurdles of TEVV and certification.},

abstract="The paper presents a first tentative work that investigates the interest and the questions raised by the introduction of argumentation capabilities in multiple criteria decision-making. Emphasizing the positive and the negative aspects of possible choices, by means of arguments in favor or against them is valuable to the user of a decision-support system. In agreement with the symbolic character of arguments, the proposed approach remains qualitative in nature and uses a bipolar scale for the assessment of criteria. The paper formalises a multicriteria decision problem within a logical argumentation system. An illustrative example is provided. Various decision principles are considered, whose psychological validity is assessed by an experimental study.",

@article{Szpak2020,
abstract = {Along with the rapid development and proliferation of autonomous robotic weapons, machines are beginning to replace people on battlefields. The use by the USA of Predators or Reapers and other unmanned aerial vehicles in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other places in the world clearly signals a distancing of soldiers from their targets. In this article I concentrate on fully autonomous weapons. The theses of the article are as follows: the use of autonomous weapons would be contrary to the basic and fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, such as the principles of distinction and proportionality, and thus illegal. As such, their use would threaten the wellbeing, life and health of civilians and civilian populations. Their use would undermine the whole concept of the rules of war. Still, there are scholars who are of the opinion that prohibiting the use of autonomous weapons would make no sense at all and that the development of such weapons is inevitable and will take place gradually. Their use would be an expression of the technological dimension of international security. As this article will attempt to demonstrate, the drawbacks of the use of autonomous weapons are of such magnitude that they exclude the legality of such devices.},

abstract = {For Dungʼs model of abstract argumentation under preferred semantics, argumentation frameworks may have several distinct preferred extensions: i.e., in informal terms, sets of acceptable arguments. Thus the acceptance problem (for a specific argument) can consider deciding whether an argument is in at least one such extensions (credulously accepted) or in all such extensions (skeptically accepted). We start by presenting a new algorithm that enumerates all preferred extensions. Following this we build algorithms that decide the acceptance problem without requiring explicit enumeration of all extensions. We analyze the performance of our algorithms by comparing these to existing ones, and present experimental evidence that the new algorithms are more efficient with respect to the expected running time. Moreover, we extend our techniques to solve decision problems in a widely studied development of Dungʼs model: namely value-based argumentation frameworks (vafs). In this regard, we examine analogous notions to the problem of enumerating preferred extensions and present algorithms that decide subjective, respectively objective, acceptance.}
