\chapter{Utilizing the Framework: Data Market Places}
\label{ch:cmf}

This chapter illustrates an example use-case and implemented model that utilizes the ASC2 framework and the normative extensions in the previous chapters. The presented example is about Data Market Places (DMPs), an infrastructure for data-sharing that can handle the complexities of sharing data between different parties. //NEEDS REWRITE LATER

\section{Introduction}
The intrinsic and potential value of data in many different aspects of human society can not be overestimated, from financial \cite{Hasan2020} to scientific research \cite{Yuri2013} and healthcare \cite{Shilo2020}, every important sector is impacted, and arguably improved in their effectiveness\footnote{At least subjectively improved.} by utilizing data-oriented approaches. Intuitively, the importance of data-sharing between parties is also rising, which in turns creates concern about data security, privacy, legal, monopoly and many other issues specially in the contexts that parties may not have full trust towards each other or are even competitors \cite{clifton2004privacy} creating the need for governance approaches that go beyond single organization scenarios. 

The idea of Data-Market Places (DMPs) is one that addresses these issues, a DMP is a membership organization that each member can only perform actions based on previously constructed contractual agreements \cite{Zhang2019ModelingPlaces,Shakeri2019}, consortium policies and legislative regulations.
